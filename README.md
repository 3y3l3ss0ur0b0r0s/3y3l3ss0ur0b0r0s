👋 Hi, I’m **@3y3l3ss0ur0b0r0s**! 🙂

- **🛠I'm currently working on**
  - freeCodeCamp, general programming and software engineering concepts, transferring to an online school for Software Engineering, and a bunch of other irrelevant things. 😀
- **🌱 Languages I'm working with**
  - *Python*, *JavaScript*, *C#*, *C++*, *HTML5 & CSS*, *PostgreSQL*, *SQL*, *SQLite*, *Java*
