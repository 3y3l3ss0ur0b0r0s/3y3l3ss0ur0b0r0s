👋 Hi, I’m **@3y3l3ss0ur0b0r0s**! I am a CS drop-out and a current 8 to 5 workhorse. 🙂

- **👀 I’m mostly interested in** game development, but I'm studying other things because I need a job... I'm also into art; I draw a bit and am a beginner at 3D modeling and animation (*Blender*).
- **🛠I'm currently working on**
  - freeCodeCamp, going back to school, and a bunch of other irrelevant things. 😀
- **🌱 My current CS-related learning list is below!**
  - *Python*, *JavaScript*, *C# (for Unity)*, *C++*, *ActionScript 3.0*, *Bootstrap*, *jQuery*, *Sass*, *HTML5 & CSS*, *React & Redux*, *PostgreSQL*, *Java*, *Unix & Linux command lines*, *basic networking*, *data structures & algorithms*, *basic computer architecture*
- **🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on** web development projects, games, Discord bots, anything to help me learn! Let me know if there's anything I can do for you!
- **📫 You can reach me on Discord at:** gummy.world. 😀
